* xlsx-universal

xlsx-universal allows the user to convert an XLSX workbook into a JavaScript array, or "universal object" to put it hyperbolically.

The idea is formulated from the classic quote:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
"It is better to have 100 functions operate on one data structure than 10 functions on 10 data structures." -- Alan Perlis
#+END_QUOTE

Simply call =XLSXUniversal.Converter.convert(wb)= to use it, where =wb= is an XLSX workbook object.

The object returned is an array of sheets. Each sheet is a 2D array.
